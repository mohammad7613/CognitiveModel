[x] Check EM objective Function for fixed sigma 
    you need to check that for a fixed sigma. The optimal point is the same as real parameter 
    The optimal point is approximately the same as real parameter for several subjects I have checked.
    However, chaning the prior parameter or even sigma could shift the optimal point toward the optimal point.

[x] Check the behavior of the objective function for different sigma and check which sigma is suitable in term of optimal point close to real parameter
        Increasing the sigma makes the optimal point in E_step objective function more selective.
        


[] Check the path of optimization for fixed sigma and set the suitable learning rate and iteration


[] Check the Total EM for fixed sigam and the optimal configuration


[] Repeat the above procedure for guassian generative process.
