Cognitive Models Package

A Python package for cognitive modeling, implementing tasks, learning models, and parameter fitting for cognitive neuroscience research. This package provides a modular framework with classes for tasks, reinforcement learning-based cognitive models, and statistical methods for fitting model parameters to human behavioral data.

⚠️ Note: This package is under active development and incomplete. Features are being added, and contributions or feedback are welcome!

Installation

Prerequisites





Python 3.8 or higher



pip

Dependencies

The package requires the following dependencies, which are automatically installed:





numpy



torch



joblib



tqdm



pandas



matplotlib



cloudpickle

Install the Package

Clone the repository and install the package in editable mode for development:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cognitive_models.git
cd cognitive_models
pip install -e .

Usage

The package is organized into three submodules:





tasks: Classes for defining cognitive neuroscience tasks.



learning: Classes for developing cognitive models, including reinforcement learning.



fitting: Statistical methods for fitting model parameters to behavioral data.

Example usage (to be expanded as the package develops):

from cognitive_models.tasks import SomeTaskClass
# Initialize and use task (example placeholder)

Check the subfolder documentation or source code for implemented classes.
